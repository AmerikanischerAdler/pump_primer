## Inspiration

For all writers, it can be difficult to find motivation and inspiration during
wiritng session. After reading *Writing with Power* by Peter Elbow for a
university course in Advanced Writing, I decided to implement Elbow's brilliant
methods into my own sessions. Whether I'm writing an essay, a narrative, a poem,
or a blog post, these questions have given my mind both insight and focus, in
order to perform at a place of highest productivity and creativity.
